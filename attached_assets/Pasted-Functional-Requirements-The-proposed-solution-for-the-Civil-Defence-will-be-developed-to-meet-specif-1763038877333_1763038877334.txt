Functional Requirements
The proposed solution for the Civil Defence will be developed to meet specific objectives and deliverables,
incorporating a range of key features and functionalities designed to support the Civil Defence. Below is a
16
detailed breakdown of the scope of work, incorporating all essential elements and additional details:
Key Deliverables
A software for registration of volunteers would likely have the following scope:
• User Registration & Profile Management: The system should allow volunteers (particularly exservicemen
or civilians) to create user accounts and register their personal, contact, and service
details. It should support uploading of relevant documents such as ID proof, service certificates, and
photographs.
• Verification & Approval Process: The software should allow ex-servicemen to create accounts and
register their personal and service details. This might include fields for name, contact information,
service history, and any relevant documents or certificates.
• Role-based Access: Different access levels should be defined for administrators, verifiers, and
volunteers to ensure data security and proper authorization.
• Communication Module: The system should facilitate notifications and updates via SMS, email, or
in-app alerts regarding registration status, training schedules, and deployment information.
• Data security: The software should have measures in place to protect the confidentiality and security
of the data, including encryption and access controls.
• Reporting & Analytics: The software should generate various statistical and operational reports (e.g.,
total registered volunteers, district-wise data, training completion status) to aid in decision-making
and planning.
• Admin Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard for Civil Defence authorities to monitor
registrations, approvals, and overall volunteer management activities in real time.
• Scalability & Maintenance: The system should be scalable to accommodate future enhancements
and increased user load, with provisions for regular updates and maintenance.
The following are the module wise functional requirement, which the implementing agency is intended to
develop under this assignment.
Design & development of Volunteer Registration and Profile Management Module
This Module is comparatively broader with improved vision in terms of following sectors-
• Capture personal information (name, contact details, address, etc.).
17
• Document identification details (ID number, social security number, etc.).
• Record skills, qualifications, and training certifications.
• Store medical history and emergency contact information.
Design & development of Incident Reporting Module
• Provide an interface for volunteers to report incidents or emergencies.
• Include incident details (location, nature, severity, etc.).
• Assign and track incidents to specific volunteers or teams.
• Allow for timestamping and geolocation tagging of incidents.
• Develop a mobile app for volunteers to easily access and use the system on the field.
• Enable offline functionality for incident reporting in areas with limited connectivity.
• Collect feedback from volunteers regarding incidents, training, and overall experience.
• Conduct periodic evaluations to assess the performance and satisfaction of volunteers.
Design & development of Inventory Management Module
• Maintain a comprehensive list of available equipment and resources.
• Track the quantity, condition, and location of each item.
• Allow for categorization (e.g., medical supplies, communication equipment, vehicles, etc.).
Design & development of Admin Module
• Monitor and oversee the volunteer registration process.
• Approve or reject volunteer applications based on predefined criteria.
• View and edit volunteer profiles for accuracy and completeness.
• Review and validate incident reports submitted by volunteers.
• Assign incidents to appropriate response teams or volunteers.
• Monitor incident status and progress.
• Supervise the inventory database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
• Add, edit, or remove inventory items as needed.
• Track inventory usage and availability.
• Etc.
Additional Features
User Dashboard & MIS reports:
• A personalized dashboard for each user, displaying relevant information such as
pending applications, notifications, and bookmarked content.
• The dashboard will be customizable, allowing users to prioritize the information
18
and tools they use most frequently.
The dashboard should have a dynamic interface enabling the user to get updated information.
Each user should have a separate dashboard according to their roles. User will be able to take
action on the pending items through the dashboard. Dashboard will provide graphical
representation of the data (Charts & Graphs). It should allow reports to be generated in Excel,
CSV and PDF format. System will facilitate dynamic query builder feature in the application,
dashboard visual representation of Data/ Statistics for individual authorities based on access
rights until Division level to Department level. The features
• Generate reports on volunteer demographics, incident trends, and inventory usage.
• Provide visual dashboards for quick insights into key metrics.
• Allow for customizable reporting based on specific criteria.
Dashboard Settings: Configurable to Prioritize the registered candidate,
important Projects/Schemes of Department and the number of registrations
being processed. This could include data on customer feedback or satisfaction
with the registration process.
Officer's Login: Officer's personalized login will configure to access the
Dashboard.
Administrative Logins: Technical Administrator can personalize access to
tinker Settings.
Periodically Updated: Constantly Improved to Provide the Best View of
Services
Analytical Review: At a Glance to Drill Down Reports & Graphical Analysis of
Project Statistics.
Access 24x7: Access to the Dashboard from anywhere anytime with
Periodically Updated Data in Real Time.
19
Search and Filter Functionality:
• Advanced search and filtering options across all modules, allowing users to quickly
find the information and services they need.
• Includes keyword search, category filters, and sorting options for enhanced
usability.
User Matrix:
Hierarchy Roles and Rights State Level View Progress Reports
Department Level (state) View Progress Report
District Level District level administration is responsible for
registering ex-servicemen by collecting, entering and
validating the necessary information into the system.
They also have the ability to view and track the
progress of registered ex-servicemen through the use
of progress reports.
This comprehensive scope ensures that the proposed web portal for Civil Defence will not only meet
current needs but also provide a scalable, future-proof solution that supports the ongoing growth and
development.
